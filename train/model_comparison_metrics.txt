# SARIMA vs. GARCH Model Performance Comparison

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | SARIMA | GARCH |
|--------|--------|-------|
| MSE | 2.2898 | 2.5050 |
| RMSE | 1.5132 | 1.5827 |
| MAE | 0.9718 | 0.9881 |
| MAPE (%) | 23.4140 | 23.4259 |
| R² | 0.5633 | 0.5222 |

## Model Summary

### SARIMA Model
- Model specification: ARIMA(1,1,2)(0,0,1)[7]  
- AIC: 6541.978 
- BIC: 6569.403 

### GARCH Model
- Model specification: GARCH(1,1) with t-distribution
- Information criteria from GARCH model summary

## Conclusion

The SARIMA model provides a better fit to the historical data based on R² and error metrics.

Both models have strengths:
- SARIMA captures the seasonal patterns in the legislative data
- GARCH explicitly models the volatility dynamics present in the residuals

A hybrid approach might be optimal, using SARIMA for point forecasts and GARCH for volatility/uncertainty estimation.
