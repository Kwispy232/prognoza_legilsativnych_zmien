# Time Series Analysis Report

## Dataset Summary
- Number of observations: 1774
- Date range: 2020-04-19 to 2025-03-05
- Value statistics:
  - Min: 0.57
  - Max: 24.66
  - Mean: 4.52
  - Median: 4.25
  - Standard deviation: 2.29

## Stationarity Analysis
- The time series is stationary
- No transformation needed

## Seasonality Analysis
- Strongest seasonal period detected: 90 days
- Seasonal strength: 0.0597
- Seasonality is weak and may not significantly impact forecasting

## Forecasting Method Recommendations

### 1. ARIMA
- Reason: Time series is stationary with weak or no seasonality
- Implementation: `statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA`

### 2. Exponential Smoothing
- Reason: Simple and effective for stationary data
- Implementation: `statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing`

### 3. XGBoost/LightGBM with time features
- Reason: Can capture complex patterns with feature engineering
- Implementation: `xgboost.XGBRegressor or lightgbm.LGBMRegressor with date-based features`
